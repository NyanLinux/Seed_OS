This repository is an experiment of an operating system made with rust.

## Why in rust? 

1. Rust is one of the most energy efficient languages
2. It's a great way to learn
3. Why not?

## Requirements

* [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) ðŸ¦€

## Building

You can build the project by running:

```sh
cargo build
```

To create a bootable disk image from the compiled kernel, you need to install the bootimage tool:

```sh
cargo install bootimage
```


After installing, you can create the bootable disk image by running:

```sh
cargo bootimage
```
## Run

You can run the disk image in QEMU through:

```sh
cargo run
```

QEMU and the bootimage tool need to be installed for this.

## Release History

* 0.0.1
  * Work in progress
